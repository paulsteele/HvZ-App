#####Problem Statement
HvZ is a nationwide campus organization that runs a week long mock post apocalyptic humans versus zombie survival game. This game is similar to a large scale version of tag with added elements like Nerf guns. The goal of the humans is to survive the week without getting tagged by the zombie team, using the Nerf guns to hold off the zombie waves, while the goal of the zombies is to tag and infect all humans. Currently there is very little infrastructure. We want to create an app that will start, operate, and continuously run a game during the week. Existing apps have limited use outside of being a bar code scanner throughout the week. Ours will have much more utility. 

#####Project Objectives

1.	Use GPS to depict boundaries and safe zones
2.	Notifications for relevant announcements to enhance the experience
3.	Have an Admin architecture that allows broadcasts to be given to one or all participants and allow players to send in complaints
4.	Use NFC function to quickly trade information between players
5.	Implement an Alliance/Bounty system that allows communication between smaller factions in the human and zombie sides, that allows the addition or removal of players to an Alliance or to a Bounty list
6.	Keep track of in-game statistics
