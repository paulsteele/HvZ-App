#####Problem Statement
HvZ is a nationwide campus organization that has very little infrastructure.  There is not currently an application that helps run and organize a game.  We want to create an app that will structure the organization of the game, while including features that can enhance the overall experience.

#####Project Objectives

1.	Use GPS to depict boundaries and safe zones
2.	Notifications for relevant announcements to enhance the experience
3.	Have an Admin architecture that allows broadcasts to be given to one or all participants and allow players to send in complaints
4.	Use NFC function to quickly trade information between players
5.	Implement an Alliance/Bounty system that allows communication between smaller factions in the human and zombie sides, that allows the addition or removal of players to an Alliance or to a Bounty list
6.	Keep track of in-game statistics

#####Stakeholders
Users: HvZ players, schools, camps, and other organizations that may organize an HvZ game

Developers: Rob Mantzoros, Kyle Rodd, Paul Steele, Wels Lin, Mamasi Goel

Project Manager: Paul Steele

#####Deliverables

* Frontend Android application that displays statistics and tools for the game.
* Backend Java system that stores information to the Adminâ€™s personal database, which holds player info.
